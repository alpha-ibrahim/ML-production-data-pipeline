    "Data pipelines are a crucial component of machine learning systems in production. They allow us to efficiently ingest, process, and transform large amounts of data to train and serve machine learning models. However, building a data pipeline that is both robust and scalable can be a challenging task. This is where TensorFlow Extended (TFX) comes in. TFX is an end-to-end platform for building machine learning pipelines that integrates seamlessly with TensorFlow, Google's popular machine learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we will explore how to build a data pipeline for a machine learning model in production using TFX. Specifically, we will focus on performing data ingestion, validation, and transformation using TFX. We will start by discussing feature selection and its importance in building a machine learning model. Then, we will move on to ingesting the dataset and generating statistics of the dataset using TFX's Data Validation (TFDV) library. Next, we will create a schema for the dataset using TFX's Schema library, and then create separate schema environments for training and serving the model using TFX's Transform library. We will also discuss how to visualize dataset anomalies using TFDV's visualization tools. Finally, we will cover how to preprocess, transform, and engineer features using TFX's Transform library and track the provenance of the data pipeline using TFX's ML Metadata library.\n",

    "By the end of this blog post, you should have a good understanding of how to build a robust and scalable data pipeline for a machine learning model in production using TFX. Let's get started!"
